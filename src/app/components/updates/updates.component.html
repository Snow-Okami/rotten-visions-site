      <p> After majoring in Electrical engineering at a school in New York, Alfred realized that this was not one of the paths for him. He dropped everything to move back across the country to California to major in Computer Science. He knew his calling was in programming and computers, though life did not take him down this path. After being fed up with working in the Online Marketing sector, he decided it was time for a change. Frustrated with the current offerings of his favorite genre, survival games, he made it his mission to breathe some much needed life back into the decaying industry. Armed with just his wit and his keyboard, he programs the entirety of the current project so far. He has spent countless hours testing the many systems their game introduces. Using Unity3D and Visual Studio, he has created many systems such as the networking, AI, UI, and fundamental game mechanics, much of which are original innovations. He hopes one day his creations are experienced to a positive degree. </p>
